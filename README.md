Hospital Inpatient Discharges Analysis

🌍 Project Overview
This project explores patient-level hospital discharge data for total hip replacement procedures. The analysis reveals financial, operational, and demographic patterns, and delivers actionable insights for healthcare administrators, policy-makers, and researchers.

Data was sourced from a public state database and includes ~300,000 records across multiple hospitals, counties, and health service areas.

🧩 Objectives
-Uncover revenue and cost disparities across hospitals and service areas
-Profile profitability and efficiency by hospital
-Analyze demographic impacts (race, gender, age) on length of stay and cost
-Map service distribution by county and health area

🔍 Key Tasks
-Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, standardized datatypes, and dropped irrelevant columns.
-Feature Engineering: Derived new variables: cost per day, profit, and revenue per day.
-Financial Analysis: Ranked hospitals by total charges, costs, and profit. Compared efficiency (profit per patient).
-Demographic Analysis: Compared cost and outcomes by race, gender, and age group.
-Visualization: Produced 10+ charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn to support findings.

📈 Highlights & Results
-Revenue Disparity: Top 10 hospitals drive a disproportionate share of total charges and profit.
-Efficiency Outliers: Identified both highly efficient and underperforming hospitals via profit per patient.
-Demographic Insights: Detected cost/LOS disparities across race, gender, and age group.
-Geographic Spread: Case counts and performance visualized by county and health service area.
-Correlation Findings: Uncovered strong relationships between costs, revenue, and patient length of stay.
